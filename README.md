# Tic Tac Toe

This game is a part of a Made Tech Academy pair programming exercise in Software Design and Changing Requirements.


## Requirements

Using the discipline of TDD, build a game of tic tac toe.

* The game should allow a human to play against an AI.
* The AI should be unbeatable.
* The game should have a user interface of some kind.


## Rules

* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

* You are X, your opponent is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

* The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

* If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is over.
